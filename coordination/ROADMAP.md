- add offline fixtures and default tests

## Phase 2: DataHub Comprehensive Source Collection

Status: In progress

Goals:

- collect comprehensive data-source coverage for the current product scope
- cover A-share full-market data, including reference, calendar, price/volume, corporate actions, valuation, capital flow, and quality metadata
- cover Hong Kong stock full-market data, including reference, calendar, price/volume, corporate actions, valuation where available, and quality metadata
- cover ETF and fund data, including reference, price/volume, holdings or composition where available, flow/scale where available, and quality metadata
- cover index data for China, Hong Kong, and key global benchmarks
- cover concise global equity market data for major markets and benchmark instruments
- cover industry and concept sector data, including membership, classification, and sector quote data where available
- cover global and China macroeconomic data relevant to market research
- cover policy, news, and announcement data with source provenance and update metadata
- maintain a complete DataHub source catalog and coverage matrix across all required domains
- implement source adapters for every approved source/dataset/domain needed by the expanded Phase 2 scope
- persist raw and normalized data locally
- add update metadata for source refreshes
- add data quality checks for collected datasets
- add mandatory live-source smoke coverage for every real-source adapter or real data-fetching task, safely gated and skipped by default
- route live-enabled network/source failures through execution rework plus independent review before acceptance

Progress:

- Previous pre-rescope TASK-006 through TASK-009 Phase 2 handoffs were removed after owner-directed scope change.
- TASK-006 completed the DataHub comprehensive source catalog and coverage matrix.
- TASK-007 completed expanded domain stable dataset/schema contracts.
- TASK-008 completed expanded contract semantic validation and invalid-sample coverage.
- TASK-009 completed explicit semantic validation rules and removed broad keyword-coupled validation.
- TASK-010 completed semantic rule integrity checks to prevent schema/rule drift.
- TASK-011 completed source adapter contract foundation for comprehensive Phase 2 sources.
- TASK-012 completed the first accepted real-source AKShare adapter slice for A-share `daily_bars`, including gated live smoke evidence.
- TASK-013 completed AKShare A-share `trading_calendar`, including source-catalog alignment and gated live smoke evidence.
- TASK-014 completed AKShare Hong Kong stock `daily_bars`, including live-network root-cause evidence and a feasible fallback path for intermittent Eastmoney HK source instability.
- TASK-015 completed AKShare ETF/fund `fund_nav_snapshot`, including offline adapter coverage, exports, and gated live smoke evidence.
- TASK-016 completed AKShare China index `index_daily_bars`, including source catalog alignment, offline adapter coverage, exports, and gated live smoke evidence.
- TASK-017 completed AKShare industry/concept sector `sector_daily_bars`, including live-network diagnosis reworks and closure-ready live-enabled PASS evidence accepted by review/integration.
- TASK-018 completed AKShare `sector_master`, including live duplicate rework and closure-ready live-enabled PASS evidence accepted by review/integration.
- TASK-019 completed AKShare `sector_membership`, including live evidence + live PASS rework and closure-ready acceptance by review/integration.
- TASK-020 completed AKShare `index_constituents`, including deterministic offline tests and closure-ready live-enabled PASS evidence accepted by review/integration.
- TASK-021 completed AKShare `global_equity_snapshot`, including live-route reworks for Eastmoney/Sina instability and closure-ready live-enabled PASS evidence accepted by review/integration.
- TASK-022 completed AKShare `news_events`, including deterministic offline tests and closure-ready live-enabled PASS evidence accepted by review/integration.
- TASK-023 completed HKEX `company_announcements`, including symbol-filter rework closure and closure-ready live-enabled PASS evidence accepted by review/integration.
- TASK-024 completed AKShare China macro `macro_indicator_master` and `macro_observations`, including `is_preliminary` rework closure and closure-ready live-enabled PASS evidence accepted by review/integration.
- TASK-025 completed the local refresh metadata and `DATA_QUALITY_REPORT` baseline, including deterministic offline tests and accepted offline-only integration.
- TASK-026 completed AKShare A-share `instrument_master`, including active Shanghai/Shenzhen/Beijing stock reference records and closure-ready live-enabled PASS evidence accepted by review/integration.
- TASK-027 completed AKShare A-share `corporate_actions`, including one-symbol dividend/corporate-action records and closure-ready live-enabled PASS evidence accepted by review/integration.
- TASK-028 completed AKShare A-share `valuation_snapshot`, including live-network rework closure, source-truth optionality for `float_market_cap`, and closure-ready live-enabled PASS evidence accepted by review/integration.
- TASK-029 completed AKShare A-share `capital_flow_snapshot`, including live-network rework closure, source-truth optionality for `net_inflow` / `northbound_net_buy` / `turnover_rate`, and bounded one-symbol datacenter fallback accepted by review/integration.
- TASK-030 completed public `POLICY_DOCUMENTS` adapter coverage under `macro_policy_public_sources`, including closure-ready live-enabled PASS evidence accepted by review/integration.
- TASK-031 initial AKShare `FUND_HOLDINGS` implementation and live smoke were reviewed, but closure was blocked because adapter-side network/source-unavailability classification can raise `NameError` when `ssl.SSLError` is referenced without importing `ssl`.
- Current focus is TASK-031 classifier rework: fix the live/source unavailability classifier path and add direct deterministic coverage before fresh review/integration.
